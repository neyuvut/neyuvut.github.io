                  <h2 id = "cyoa">Choose Your Own Adventure: Happy in the Woods</h2>
            <p>There is a dog named Happy that is looking for his friend, but <br>
            must go through the woods in order to find that person. Inside the <br>
            woods, he gets lost and needs guidance. He eventually gets lost and <br>
            finds himself scared of what lurks inside the woods. </p>

            <p>The incremental and iterative process consisted of us trying to <br>
            develop a story that could fully utilize this format. We started <br>
            with the idea of some kind of medieval time period with magic, but <br>
            it was too complicated so we made the program into a children's story <br>
            Afterwards, we had to flesh out the endings that we wanted to have. <br>
            At first, we were going to have two completely separate ending, but <br>
            to simplify the story and process we linked the two paths together to <br>
            result in simply two endings. We encountered the problem of making a <br>
            story that was too complex so we simplified it down completely. The <br>
            problems we faced is that the problem lies in how many routes we wanted. <br>
            so we made it only two endings as stated before.</p>
            <p>Organizing our story into functions is a form of abstraction because <br>
            we made the process easier to understand by simplifying it into one function. <br>
            The function has the result of typing and continuing the story in the way <br>
            that suited our wants without the complication that is included with machinery. <br>
            The advantages is that we are able to understand our code and write it <br>
            in a more efficient manner.</p>
            <p>One story I read that I particularly liked is one that included a sort <br>
            of dating simulator for a woman where she could choose to study or date a rich man. <br>
            I found the story and the endings quite entertaining. </p>

            <h2>GAME DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>The context of the game is that the player is making a new <br>
            startup company. The scoring system consists of how much money <br>
            the company has in terms of cash money.The randomness occurs when <br>
            the game chooses a random number that decides how much money the <br>
            player loses or gains. The game gets more difficult because the more<br>
            employees that the player has,then the more money they lose when the<br>
            number chosen results in cash money lost. The game ends or the player <br>
            loses when they go bankrupt by having -5000 cash money. 
            </p>

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>I created this game because I'm interested in the aspect of creating <br>
            a business and being an entrepreneur. My inspiration is Victoria 2 <br>
            because, even though the economic aspect is not the main point of the <br>
            game, the mechanic of trying to support an economy was quite interesting. <br>
            The two succeessful points were that I created a random number generator <br>
            that was useful for the game and the game did not have any game breaking <br>
            features. The two obstacles were that I was balancing the difficulty <br>
            of the game which was either too hard or too easy and simply not <br>
            being knowledgeable enough for certain mechanics that would be too <br>
            complex. I would improve the random number generator as it feels <br>
            a little off and the feel of it. 
            </p>

            <h2>ALGORITHM</h2>
            <p>It is an algorithm because it follows a step by step procedure by <br>
            first brodcasting a number from 1 to 10 and then performing a result <br>
            on the cash money. This is the main mechanic of my game as the whole <br>
            game consists of the flucuation of money based on this algorithm.
