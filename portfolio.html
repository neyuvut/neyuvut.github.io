            <h2>GAME DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>The context of the game is that the player is making a new <br>
            startup company. The scoring system consists of how much money <br>
            the company has in terms of cash money.The randomness occurs when <br>
            the game chooses a random number that decides how much money the <br>
            player loses or gains. The game gets more difficult because the more<br>
            employees that the player has,then the more money they lose when the<br>
            number chosen results in cash money lost. The game ends or the player <br>
            loses when they go bankrupt by having -5000 cash money.

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>I created this game because I'm interested in the aspect of creating <br>
            a business and being an entrepreneur. My inspiration is Victoria 2 <br>
            because, even though the economic aspect is not the main point of the <br>
            game, the mechanic of trying to support an economy was quite interesting. <br>
            The two succeessful points were that I created a random number generator <br>
            that was useful for the game and the game did not have any game breaking <br>
            features. The two obstacles were that I was balancing the difficulty <br>
            of the game which was either too hard or too easy and simply not <br>
            being knowledgeable enough for certain mechanics that would be too <br>
            complex. I would improve the random number generator as it feels <br>
            a little off and the feel of it.

            <h2>ALGORITHM</h2>
            <p>It is an algorithm because it follows a step by step procedure by <br>
            first brodcasting a number from 1 to 10 and then performing a result <br>
            on the cash money. This is the main mechanic of my game as the whole <br>
            game consists of the flucuation of money based on this algorithm.
